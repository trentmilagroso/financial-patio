Still trying to figure out how to make this more accurate, as right now, the cross-validation score is at a 52%.

Uses random forest classifier instead of linear regression as stock is volatile. Instead of linear relationships, it is easier for stocks to use random forest to create however many decision trees and takes the average of X to output Y.

This is a project that I used to teach me fundamentals on machine learning, specifically about random forests and decision trees, as well as how they work data wise.
It also taught me how to visualize and clean data, as well as identify what values and data is actually used by the model.
